# MainframeDevFinalProject
This project includes the files for the final group project of Mainframe Development I.

This project involved the use of components frequently used during the course. It begins with the first program in which a data file is sorted through either valid or invalid data and is outputted for further processing. The second program takes the valid information given from the first program and processes the total amount of sales or layaways and returns to a report, also producing two more data files for further processing. The third program then takes the sales and layaways information from the second program and processes the total amounts per store, taxes and percentage of payment methods into a formatted report. Finally, the last program takes the return information given from the second program and processes the returns per store and taxes owed, then places them into a formatted report. Overall, this final solution was straight forward and successful, concluding a great semester.
